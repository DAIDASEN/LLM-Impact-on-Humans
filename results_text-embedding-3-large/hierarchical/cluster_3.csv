Experimental evidence on the productivity effects of generative artificial intelligence,"We examined the productivity effects of a generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the assistive chatbot ChatGPT, in the context of midlevel professional writing tasks. In a preregistered online experiment, we assigned occupation-specific, incentivized writing tasks to 453 college-educated professionals and randomly exposed half of them to ChatGPT. Our results show that ChatGPT substantially raised productivity: The average time taken decreased by 40% and output quality rose by 18%. Inequality between workers decreased, and concern and excitement about AI temporarily rose. Workers exposed to ChatGPT during the experiment were 2 times as likely to report using it in their real job 2 weeks after the experiment and 1.6 times as likely 2 months after the experiment.",2,3,Science,2023,https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adh2586,Productivity,GPT 3.5,453,Conversation,2 months,"ChatGPT substantially raised productivity: The average time taken decreased by 40% and output quality rose by 18%.

An empirical investigation of the impact of ChatGPT on creativity,"This paper investigates the potential of ChatGPT for helping humans tackle problems that require creativity. Across five experiments, we asked participants to use ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) to generate creative ideas for various everyday and innovation-related problems, including choosing a creative gift for a teenager, making a toy, repurposing unused items and designing an innovative dining table. We found that using ChatGPT increased the creativity of the generated ideas compared with not using any technology or using a conventional Web search (Google). This effect remained robust regardless of whether the problem required consideration of many (versus few) constraints and whether it was viewed as requiring empathetic concern. Furthermore, ChatGPT was most effective at generating incrementally (versus radically) new ideas. Process evidence suggests that the positive influence of ChatGPT can be attributed to its capability to combine remotely related concepts into a cohesive form, leading to a more articulate presentation of ideas.",2,3,Nature Human Behavior,2024,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01953-1,Creativity,GPT-3.5,233,Conversation,F,"1. ChatGPT Enhances Creativity: Using ChatGPT significantly improves the creativity (originality and appropriateness) of generated ideas compared to using no technology or traditional web search (Google). 
2. Type of Creativity: ChatGPT is particularly effective at generating incrementally new ideas (improving/combining existing concepts) rather than radically new ones, likely due to its reliance on existing data. 
3. Mechanism: Its strength lies in combining distantly related concepts into cohesive, articulate forms, acting as an 'idea exposition aid' that improves 'idea articulateness'.
4. Role of Human Modification: For lay participants, further modifying ChatGPT's raw output does not significantly enhance creativity ratings, suggesting potential for automated creativity generation, though expert input might differ.",
Creative scar without generative AI: Individual creativity fails to sustain while homogeneity keeps climbing,"Generative AI such as ChatGPT has been proven to enhance human creativity at the cost of content diversity. Yet, what occurs when individuals, who have developed a dependency on it, find ChatGPT inaccessible? In this study, we examine the impact of both the presence and absence of ChatGPT on sustained creative output and content homogeneity, leveraging two complementary methodologies: a natural experiment (Study 1) and a controlled laboratory experiment with extended follow-ups (Study 2). Study 1 analyzed 419,344 academic papers published before and after ChatGPT-3.5’s release across all subjects categorized by Web of Science (i.e., Physical Sciences, Life Sciences & Biomedicine, Technology, Social Sciences, Arts & Humanities). Study 2, a seven-day laboratory experiment with two follow-up surveys, collected 3593 original ideas and 427 solutions across 18 different creative tasks, with half of the participants using ChatGPT-4. We find that although generative AI helps scholars to publish more academic works in higher-ranked journals and enhances individuals' performance in creative tasks, such creativity drops remarkably upon withdrawal of AI assistance. Strikingly, the induced content homogeneity keeps climbing even months later. We resemble the latter as a creative scar inked in the temporal creativity trajectory. This research identifies a creativity illusion that although generative AI can augment creative performance, users do not truly acquire the ability to create but easily lost it once generative AI is no longer available.",2,3,Technology in Society,2026,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X25002775,Creativity,GPT 3.5 / GPT4o,"419,344 article+61 students",Indirect,30 days/ 60 days,"1. The study identified a ""Creativity Illusion"": 
While the presence of Generative AI (like GPT) is associated with an increase in creative output, with the average number of papers published per scholar per year increasing by 0.9 and the likelihood of publishing in higher-ranking journals increasing by 6%, this performance boost comes at the cost of increased content homogeneity. Specifically, the similarity in language style increased by 79% annually, and content similarity increased by 7% (suggesting a convergence of research interests/hot topics). 

2. Upon the withdrawal of AI assistance, individual creativity significantly declines, but the homogeneity persists—a phenomenon the paper terms a ""Creative Scar.""",
"Generative artificial intelligence, human creativity, and art","Recent artificial intelligence (AI) tools have demonstrated the ability to produce outputs traditionally considered creative. One such system is text-to-image generative AI (e.g. Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E), which automates humans’ artistic execution to generate digital artworks. Utilizing a dataset of over 4 million artworks from more than 50,000 unique users, our research shows that over time, text-to-image AI significantly enhances human creative productivity by 25% and increases the value as measured by the likelihood of receiving a favorite per view by 50%. While peak artwork Content Novelty, defined as focal subject matter and relations, increases over time, average Content Novelty declines, suggesting an expanding but inefficient idea space. Additionally, there is a consistent reduction in both peak and average Visual Novelty, captured by pixel-level stylistic elements. Importantly, AI-assisted artists who can successfully explore more novel ideas, regardless of their prior originality, may produce artworks that their peers evaluate more favorably. Lastly, AI adoption decreased value capture (favorites earned) concentration among adopters. The results suggest that ideation and filtering are likely necessary skills in the text-to-image process, thus giving rise to “generative synesthesia”—the harmonious blending of human exploration and AI exploitation to discover new creative workflows.",2,3,PNAS Nexus,2024,https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/3/3/pgae052/7618478,Creativity (Art),Midjourney,>5800,Detect whether AI,6 months,"1. The performance of AI-generated art is very good. Six months after adoption, the value of artworks, measured as favorites per view, increased by 50%. Artist productivity increased by 50% in the month of adoption and subsequently doubled. AI can improve the efficiency of artists in executing their ideas. 

2. However, when AI is used for creation, novelty tends to decrease. Therefore, the process should be a fusion of AI and the artist : the artist provides the ideas (""ideation"") and AI executes them.",T2I
Generative AI enhances individual creativity but reduces the collective diversity of novel content,"Creativity is core to being human. Generative artificial intelligence (AI)—including powerful large language models (LLMs)—holds promise for humans to be more creative by offering new ideas, or less creative by anchoring on generative AI ideas. We study the causal impact of generative AI ideas on the production of short stories in an online experiment where some writers obtained story ideas from an LLM. We find that access to generative AI ideas causes stories to be evaluated as more creative, better written, and more enjoyable, especially among less creative writers. However, generative AI–enabled stories are more similar to each other than stories by humans alone. These results point to an increase in individual creativity at the risk of losing collective novelty. This dynamic resembles a social dilemma: With generative AI, writers are individually better off, but collectively a narrower scope of novel content is produced. Our results have implications for researchers, policy-makers, and practitioners interested in bolstering creativity.",2,3,Science,2024,https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adn5290,Creativity,GPT-4,300,"AI generates ideas, and human writers complete the work.",F,"1. Stories written with AI assistance were evaluated as being better than those written by humans alone. This improvement was particularly significant for writers who were deemed less creative to begin with. 

2. However, the AI-assisted ideas suffer from severe homogenization. The stories produced by the AI-assisted groups were much more similar to each other than the stories produced by the human-only group.",
"The paradox of creativity in generative AI: high performance, human-like bias, and limited differential evaluation","Creativity plays a crucial role in helping individuals and organisations generate innovative solutions to arising challenges. To support this creative process, generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as ChatGPT is being used increasingly. However, whether such a generative AI model can truly enhance creativity or whether it exhibits similar creative biases to humans is unclear. This study, conducted in 2025, consisted of an experiment which involved ChatGPT-4o performing the egg task, a creativity task which measures fixation bias and original idea generation (expansion). The AI model's results were compared both to a sample of 47 human participants and to aggregated data from eight previous studies using the same procedure with the egg task. This dual comparison provides a comprehensive perspective on creative biases in both AI and humans at multiple levels. While ChatGPT demonstrated greater productivity than humans, it exhibited a comparable fixation bias, with most ideas falling within conventional categories. Furthermore, the model showed a limited capability to differentially evaluate originality, as it struggled to distinguish between original and conventional ideas, unlike humans who are typically able to make this distinction. In conclusion, although generative AI demonstrates impressive fluency by producing a large number of creative ideas, its inability to critically assess their originality and overcome the fixation bias highlights the necessity of human involvement, particularly for properly evaluating and filtering the ideas generated.",2,3,Frontiers in Psychology,2025,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1628486/full,Creativity,GPT-4o,47,Conversation,F,"1. AI demonstrated considerably higher fluency, producing a greater overall number of ideas than humans within the time limit.

2. AI exhibited a comparable fixation bias to humans, with the majority of its ideas falling within conventional categories.

3. AI showed a limited capability to differentially evaluate originality and struggled to distinguish between original and conventional ideas, unlike humans who typically can. This highlights the necessity of human involvement for proper evaluation and filtering.",
