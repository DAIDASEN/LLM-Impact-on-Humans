Experimental evidence on the productivity effects of generative artificial intelligence,"We examined the productivity effects of a generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the assistive chatbot ChatGPT, in the context of midlevel professional writing tasks. In a preregistered online experiment, we assigned occupation-specific, incentivized writing tasks to 453 college-educated professionals and randomly exposed half of them to ChatGPT. Our results show that ChatGPT substantially raised productivity: The average time taken decreased by 40% and output quality rose by 18%. Inequality between workers decreased, and concern and excitement about AI temporarily rose. Workers exposed to ChatGPT during the experiment were 2 times as likely to report using it in their real job 2 weeks after the experiment and 1.6 times as likely 2 months after the experiment."
Your Brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of Cognitive Debt when Using an AI Assistant for Essay Writing Task,"This study explores the neural and behavioral consequences of LLM-assisted essay writing. Participants were divided into three groups: LLM, Search Engine, and Brain-only (no tools). Each completed three sessions under the same condition. In a fourth session, LLM users were reassigned to Brain-only group (LLM-to-Brain), and Brain-only users were reassigned to LLM condition (Brain-to-LLM). A total of 54 participants took part in Sessions 1-3, with 18 completing session 4. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess cognitive load during essay writing, and analyzed essays using NLP, as well as scoring essays with the help from human teachers and an AI judge. Across groups, NERs, n-gram patterns, and topic ontology showed within-group homogeneity. EEG revealed significant differences in brain connectivity: Brain-only participants exhibited the strongest, most distributed networks; Search Engine users showed moderate engagement; and LLM users displayed the weakest connectivity. Cognitive activity scaled down in relation to external tool use. In session 4, LLM-to-Brain participants showed reduced alpha and beta connectivity, indicating under-engagement. Brain-to-LLM users exhibited higher memory recall and activation of occipito-parietal and prefrontal areas, similar to Search Engine users. Self-reported ownership of essays was the lowest in the LLM group and the highest in the Brain-only group. LLM users also struggled to accurately quote their own work. While LLMs offer immediate convenience, our findings highlight potential cognitive costs. Over four months, LLM users consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels. These results raise concerns about the long-term educational implications of LLM reliance and underscore the need for deeper inquiry into AI's role in learning."
An empirical investigation of the impact of ChatGPT on creativity,"This paper investigates the potential of ChatGPT for helping humans tackle problems that require creativity. Across five experiments, we asked participants to use ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) to generate creative ideas for various everyday and innovation-related problems, including choosing a creative gift for a teenager, making a toy, repurposing unused items and designing an innovative dining table. We found that using ChatGPT increased the creativity of the generated ideas compared with not using any technology or using a conventional Web search (Google). This effect remained robust regardless of whether the problem required consideration of many (versus few) constraints and whether it was viewed as requiring empathetic concern. Furthermore, ChatGPT was most effective at generating incrementally (versus radically) new ideas. Process evidence suggests that the positive influence of ChatGPT can be attributed to its capability to combine remotely related concepts into a cohesive form, leading to a more articulate presentation of ideas."
Creative scar without generative AI: Individual creativity fails to sustain while homogeneity keeps climbing,"Generative AI such as ChatGPT has been proven to enhance human creativity at the cost of content diversity. Yet, what occurs when individuals, who have developed a dependency on it, find ChatGPT inaccessible? In this study, we examine the impact of both the presence and absence of ChatGPT on sustained creative output and content homogeneity, leveraging two complementary methodologies: a natural experiment (Study 1) and a controlled laboratory experiment with extended follow-ups (Study 2). Study 1 analyzed 419,344 academic papers published before and after ChatGPT-3.5’s release across all subjects categorized by Web of Science (i.e., Physical Sciences, Life Sciences & Biomedicine, Technology, Social Sciences, Arts & Humanities). Study 2, a seven-day laboratory experiment with two follow-up surveys, collected 3593 original ideas and 427 solutions across 18 different creative tasks, with half of the participants using ChatGPT-4. We find that although generative AI helps scholars to publish more academic works in higher-ranked journals and enhances individuals' performance in creative tasks, such creativity drops remarkably upon withdrawal of AI assistance. Strikingly, the induced content homogeneity keeps climbing even months later. We resemble the latter as a creative scar inked in the temporal creativity trajectory. This research identifies a creativity illusion that although generative AI can augment creative performance, users do not truly acquire the ability to create but easily lost it once generative AI is no longer available."
Human Creativity in the Age of LLMs: Randomized Experiments on Divergent and Convergent Thinking,"Large language models are transforming the creative process by offering unprecedented capabilities to algorithmically generate ideas. While these tools can enhance human creativity when people co-create with them, it’s unclear how this will impact unassisted human creativity. We conducted two large pre-registered parallel experiments involving 1,100 participants attempting tasks targeting the two core components of creativity, divergent and convergent thinking. We compare the effects of two forms of large language model (LLM) assistance—a standard LLM providing direct answers and a coach-like LLM offering guidance—with a control group receiving no AI assistance, and focus particularly on how all groups perform in a final, unassisted stage. Our findings reveal that while LLM assistance can provide short-term boosts in creativity during assisted tasks, it may inadvertently hinder independent creative performance when users work without assistance, raising concerns about the long-term impact on human creativity and cognition."
Inspiration booster or creative fixation? The dual mechanisms of LLMs in shaping individual creativity in tasks of different complexity,"The emergence of large language models (LLMs) presents opportunities for stimulating unlimited creative potential. However, how LLMs influence individual creativity remains unclear. Therefore, this paper examines the dual-opposing mechanisms through which LLMs influence individual creativity. In Experiment 1, each participant collaborated with a human partner or a general, unconstrained LLM partner to complete creative tasks. The results showed that compared to collaborating with the human partner, collaborating with the LLM partner significantly improved individual creativity in simple tasks, attributable to inspiration stimulation. However, in complex tasks, collaborating with the LLM partner led to a decrease in creativity, attributable to creative fixation. To mitigate this impact, in Experiment 2, participants were instructed to collaborate with batch-responsive LLM or constrained-responsive LLM to complete creative tasks. We found that constraining the output of LLMs effectively mitigated the creative fixation they induce in complex tasks, thereby enhancing creative performance. However, this constraint may weaken the positive effects of inspiration stimulation in simple tasks. These findings provide insights for the differentiated application of LLMs in creative tasks."
"Generative artificial intelligence, human creativity, and art","Recent artificial intelligence (AI) tools have demonstrated the ability to produce outputs traditionally considered creative. One such system is text-to-image generative AI (e.g. Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E), which automates humans’ artistic execution to generate digital artworks. Utilizing a dataset of over 4 million artworks from more than 50,000 unique users, our research shows that over time, text-to-image AI significantly enhances human creative productivity by 25% and increases the value as measured by the likelihood of receiving a favorite per view by 50%. While peak artwork Content Novelty, defined as focal subject matter and relations, increases over time, average Content Novelty declines, suggesting an expanding but inefficient idea space. Additionally, there is a consistent reduction in both peak and average Visual Novelty, captured by pixel-level stylistic elements. Importantly, AI-assisted artists who can successfully explore more novel ideas, regardless of their prior originality, may produce artworks that their peers evaluate more favorably. Lastly, AI adoption decreased value capture (favorites earned) concentration among adopters. The results suggest that ideation and filtering are likely necessary skills in the text-to-image process, thus giving rise to “generative synesthesia”—the harmonious blending of human exploration and AI exploitation to discover new creative workflows."
Generative AI enhances individual creativity but reduces the collective diversity of novel content,"Creativity is core to being human. Generative artificial intelligence (AI)—including powerful large language models (LLMs)—holds promise for humans to be more creative by offering new ideas, or less creative by anchoring on generative AI ideas. We study the causal impact of generative AI ideas on the production of short stories in an online experiment where some writers obtained story ideas from an LLM. We find that access to generative AI ideas causes stories to be evaluated as more creative, better written, and more enjoyable, especially among less creative writers. However, generative AI–enabled stories are more similar to each other than stories by humans alone. These results point to an increase in individual creativity at the risk of losing collective novelty. This dynamic resembles a social dilemma: With generative AI, writers are individually better off, but collectively a narrower scope of novel content is produced. Our results have implications for researchers, policy-makers, and practitioners interested in bolstering creativity."
"The paradox of creativity in generative AI: high performance, human-like bias, and limited differential evaluation","Creativity plays a crucial role in helping individuals and organisations generate innovative solutions to arising challenges. To support this creative process, generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as ChatGPT is being used increasingly. However, whether such a generative AI model can truly enhance creativity or whether it exhibits similar creative biases to humans is unclear. This study, conducted in 2025, consisted of an experiment which involved ChatGPT-4o performing the egg task, a creativity task which measures fixation bias and original idea generation (expansion). The AI model's results were compared both to a sample of 47 human participants and to aggregated data from eight previous studies using the same procedure with the egg task. This dual comparison provides a comprehensive perspective on creative biases in both AI and humans at multiple levels. While ChatGPT demonstrated greater productivity than humans, it exhibited a comparable fixation bias, with most ideas falling within conventional categories. Furthermore, the model showed a limited capability to differentially evaluate originality, as it struggled to distinguish between original and conventional ideas, unlike humans who are typically able to make this distinction. In conclusion, although generative AI demonstrates impressive fluency by producing a large number of creative ideas, its inability to critically assess their originality and overcome the fixation bias highlights the necessity of human involvement, particularly for properly evaluating and filtering the ideas generated."
AI Suggestions Homogenize Writing Toward Western Styles and Diminish Cultural Nuances,"Large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly integrated into everyday products and services, such as coding tools and writing assistants. As these embedded AI applications are deployed globally, there is a growing concern that the AI models underlying these applications prioritize Western values. This paper investigates what happens when a Western-centric AI model provides writing suggestions to users from a different cultural background. We conducted a cross-cultural controlled experiment with 118 participants from India and the United States who completed culturally grounded writing tasks with and without AI suggestions. Our analysis reveals that AI provided greater efficiency gains for Americans compared to Indians. Moreover, AI suggestions led Indian participants to adopt Western writing styles, altering not just what is written but also how it is written. These findings show that Western-centric AI models homogenize writing toward Western norms, diminishing nuances that differentiate cultural expression."
"Collaborating with AI Agents: Field Experiments on Teamwork, Productivity, and Performance","To uncover how AI agents change productivity, performance, and work processes, we introduce MindMeld: an experimentation platform enabling humans and AI agents to collaborate in integrative workspaces. In a large-scale marketing experiment on the platform, 2310 participants were randomly assigned to human-human and human-AI teams, with randomized AI personality traits. The teams exchanged 183,691 messages, and created 63,656 image edits, 1,960,095 ad copy edits, and 10,375 AI-generated images while producing 11,138 ads for a large think tank. Analysis of fine-grained communication, collaboration, and workflow logs revealed that collaborating with AI agents increased communication by 137% and allowed humans to focus 23% more on text and image content generation messaging and 20% less on direct text editing. Humans on Human-AI teams sent 23% fewer social messages, creating 60% greater productivity per worker and higher-quality ad copy. In contrast, human-human teams produced higher-quality images, suggesting that AI agents require fine-tuning for multimodal workflows. AI personality prompt randomization revealed that AI traits can complement human personalities to enhance collaboration. For example, conscientious humans paired with open AI agents improved image quality, while extroverted humans paired with conscientious AI agents reduced the quality of text, images, and clicks. In field tests of ad campaigns with ~5M impressions, ads with higher image quality produced by human collaborations and higher text quality produced by AI collaborations performed significantly better on click-through rate and cost per click metrics. Overall, ads created by human-AI teams performed similarly to those created by human-human teams. Together, these results suggest AI agents can improve teamwork and productivity, especially when tuned to complement human traits."
Generative AI without guardrails can harm learning: Evidence from high school mathematics,"Generative AI is poised to revolutionize how humans work, and has already demonstrated promise in significantly improving human productivity. A key question is how generative AI affects learning—namely, how humans acquire new skills as they perform tasks. Learning is critical to long-term productivity, especially since generative AI is fallible and users must check its outputs. We study this question via a field experiment where we provide nearly a thousand high school math students with access to generative AI tutors. To understand the differential impact of tool design on learning, we deploy two generative AI tutors: one that mimics a standard ChatGPT interface (“GPT Base”) and one with prompts designed to safeguard learning (“GPT Tutor”). Consistent with prior work, our results show that having GPT-4 access while solving problems significantly improves performance (48% improvement in grades for GPT Base and 127% for GPT Tutor). However, we additionally find that when access is subsequently taken away, students actually perform worse than those who never had access (17% reduction in grades for GPT Base)—i.e., unfettered access to GPT-4 can harm educational outcomes. These negative learning effects are largely mitigated by the safeguards in GPT Tutor. Without guardrails, students attempt to use GPT-4 as a “crutch” during practice problem sessions, and subsequently perform worse on their own. Thus, decision-makers must be cautious about design choices underlying generative AI deployments to preserve skill learning and long-term productivity."
"Beware of metacognitive laziness: Effects of generative artificial intelligence on learning motivation, processes, and performance","Abstract 
With the continuous development of technological and educational innovation, learners nowadays can obtain a variety of supports from agents such as teachers, peers, education technologies, and recently, generative artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT. In particular, there has been a surge of academic interest in human‐AI collaboration and hybrid intelligence in learning. The concept of hybrid intelligence is still at a nascent stage, and how learners can benefit from a symbiotic relationship with various agents such as AI, human experts and intelligent learning systems is still unknown. The emerging concept of hybrid intelligence also lacks deep insights and understanding of the mechanisms and consequences of hybrid human‐AI learning based on strong empirical research. In order to address this gap, we conducted a randomised experimental study and compared learners' motivations, self‐regulated learning processes and learning performances on a writing task among different groups who had support from different agents, that is, ChatGPT (also referred to as the AI group), chat with a human expert, writing analytics tools, and no extra tool. A total of 117 university students were recruited, and their multi‐channel learning, performance and motivation data were collected and analysed. The results revealed that: (1) learners who received different learning support showed no difference in post‐task intrinsic motivation; (2) there were significant differences in the frequency and sequences of the self‐regulated learning processes among groups; (3) ChatGPT group outperformed in the essay score improvement but their knowledge gain and transfer were not significantly different. Our research found that in the absence of differences in motivation, learners with different supports still exhibited different self‐regulated learning processes, ultimately leading to differentiated performance. What is particularly noteworthy is that AI technologies such as ChatGPT may promote learners' dependence on technology and potentially trigger “metacognitive laziness”. In conclusion, understanding and leveraging the respective strengths and weaknesses of different agents in learning is critical in the field of future hybrid intelligence. 
Practitioner notes 
What is already known about this topic 
Hybrid intelligence, combining human and machine intelligence, aims to augment human capabilities rather than replace them, creating opportunities for more effective lifelong learning and collaboration. 
Generative AI, such as ChatGPT, has shown potential in enhancing learning by providing immediate feedback, overcoming language barriers and facilitating personalised educational experiences. 
The effectiveness of AI in educational contexts varies, with some studies highlighting its benefits in improving academic performance and motivation, while others note limitations in its ability to replace human teachers entirely. 
What this paper adds 
We conducted a randomised experimental study in the lab setting and compared learners' motivations, self‐regulated learning processes and learning performances among different agent groups (AI, human expert and checklist tools). 
We found that AI technologies such as ChatGPT may promote learners' dependence on technology and potentially trigger metacognitive ""laziness"", which can potentially hinder their ability to self‐regulate and engage deeply in learning. 
We also found that ChatGPT can significantly improve short‐term task performance, but it may not boost intrinsic motivation and knowledge gain and transfer. 
Implications for practice and/or policy 
When using AI in learning, learners should focus on deepening their …"
Whether and When Could Generative AI Improve College Student Learning Engagement?,"Generative AI (GenAI) technologies have been widely adopted by college students since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. While the debate about GenAI’s role in higher education continues, there is a lack of empirical evidence regarding whether and when these technologies can improve the learning experience for college students. This study utilizes data from a survey of 72,615 undergraduate students across 25 universities and colleges in China to explore the relationships between GenAI use and student learning engagement in different learning environments. The findings reveal that over sixty percent of Chinese college students use GenAI technologies in Academic Year 2023–2024, with academic use exceeding daily use. GenAI use in academic tasks is related to more cognitive and emotional engagement, though it may also reduce active learning activities and learning motivation. Furthermore, this study highlights that the role of GenAI varies across learning environments. The positive associations of GenAI and student engagement are most prominent for students in “high-challenge and high-support” learning contexts, while GenAI use is mostly negatively associated with student engagement in “low-challenge, high-support” courses. These findings suggest that while GenAI plays a valuable role in the learning process for college students, its effectiveness is fundamentally conditioned by the instructional design of human teachers."
Mapping the increasing use of LLMs in scientific papers,"Scientific publishing lays the foundation of science by disseminating research findings, fostering collaboration, encouraging reproducibility, and ensuring that scientific knowledge is accessible, verifiable, and built upon over time. Recently, there has been immense speculation about how many people are using large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in their academic writing, and to what extent this tool might have an effect on global scientific practices. However, we lack a precise measure of the proportion of academic writing substantially modified or produced by LLMs. To address this gap, we conduct the first systematic, large-scale analysis across 950,965 papers published between January 2020 and February 2024 on the arXiv, bioRxiv, and Nature portfolio journals, using a population-level statistical framework to measure the prevalence of LLM-modified content over time. Our statistical estimation operates on the corpus level and is more robust than inference on individual instances. Our findings reveal a steady increase in LLM usage, with the largest and fastest growth observed in Computer Science papers (up to 17.5%). In comparison, Mathematics papers and the Nature portfolio showed the least LLM modification (up to 6.3%). Moreover, at an aggregate level, our analysis reveals that higher levels of LLM-modification are associated with papers whose first authors post preprints more frequently, papers in more crowded research areas, and papers of shorter lengths. Our findings suggests that LLMs are being broadly used in scientific writings."
Can LLMs Generate Novel Research Ideas? A Large-Scale Human Study with 100+ NLP Researchers,"Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have sparked optimism about their potential to accelerate scientific discovery, with a growing number of works proposing research agents that autonomously generate and validate new ideas. Despite this, no evaluations have shown that LLM systems can take the very first step of producing novel, expert-level ideas, let alone perform the entire research process. We address this by establishing an experimental design that evaluates research idea generation while controlling for confounders and performs the first head-to-head comparison between expert NLP researchers and an LLM ideation agent. By recruiting over 100 NLP researchers to write novel ideas and blind reviews of both LLM and human ideas, we obtain the first statistically significant conclusion on current LLM capabilities for research ideation: we find LLM-generated ideas are judged as more novel (p < 0.05) than human expert ideas while being judged slightly weaker on feasibility. Studying our agent baselines closely, we identify open problems in building and evaluating research agents, including failures of LLM self-evaluation and their lack of diversity in generation. Finally, we acknowledge that human judgements of novelty can be difficult, even by experts, and propose an end-to-end study design which recruits researchers to execute these ideas into full projects, enabling us to study whether these novelty and feasibility judgements result in meaningful differences in research outcome."
