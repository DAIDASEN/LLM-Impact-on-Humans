Durably reducing conspiracy beliefs through dialogues with AI,"
Conspiracy theory beliefs are notoriously persistent. Influential hypotheses propose that they fulfill important psychological needs, thus resisting counterevidence. Yet previous failures in correcting conspiracy beliefs may be due to counterevidence being insufficiently compelling and tailored. To evaluate this possibility, we leveraged developments in generative artificial intelligence and engaged 2190 conspiracy believers in personalized evidence-based dialogues with GPT-4 Turbo. The intervention reduced conspiracy belief by ~20%. The effect remained 2 months later, generalized across a wide range of conspiracy theories, and occurred even among participants with deeply entrenched beliefs. Although the dialogues focused on a single conspiracy, they nonetheless diminished belief in unrelated conspiracies and shifted conspiracy-related behavioral intentions. These findings suggest that many conspiracy theory believers can revise their views if presented with sufficiently compelling evidence","Durably reducing conspiracy beliefs through dialogues with AI [SEP]

Hidden Persuaders: LLMs’ Political Leaning and Their Influence on Voters,"Do LLMs have political leanings and are LLMs able to shift our political views? This paper explores these questions in the context of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Through a voting simulation, we demonstrate 18 open-weight and closed-source LLMs’ political preference for Biden over Trump. We show how Biden-leaning becomes more pronounced in instruction-tuned and reinforced models compared to their base versions by analyzing their responses to political questions related to the two nominees. We further explore the potential impact of LLMs on voter choice by recruiting 935 U.S. registered voters. Participants interacted with LLMs (Claude-3, Llama-3, and GPT-4) over five exchanges. Intriguingly, although LLMs were not asked to persuade users to support Biden, about 20% of Trump supporters reduced their support for Trump after LLM interaction. This result is noteworthy given that many studies on the persuasiveness of political campaigns have shown minimal effects in presidential elections. Many users also expressed a desire for further interaction with LLMs on political subjects. Further research on how LLMs affect users’ political views is required, as their use becomes more widespread.","Hidden Persuaders: LLMs’ Political Leaning and Their Influence on Voters [SEP] Do LLMs have political leanings and are LLMs able to shift our political views?

The Levers of Political Persuasion with Conversational AI,"There are widespread fears that conversational AI could soon exert unprecedented influence over human beliefs. Here, in three large-scale experiments (N=76,977), we deployed 19 LLMs-including some post-trained explicitly for persuasion-to evaluate their persuasiveness on 707 political issues. We then checked the factual accuracy of 466,769 resulting LLM claims. Contrary to popular concerns, we show that the persuasive power of current and near-future AI is likely to stem more from post-training and prompting methods-which boosted persuasiveness by as much as 51% and 27% respectively-than from personalization or increasing model scale. We further show that these methods increased persuasion by exploiting LLMs' unique ability to rapidly access and strategically deploy information and that, strikingly, where they increased AI persuasiveness they also systematically decreased factual accuracy.

Humans inherit artificial intelligence biases,"Artificial intelligence recommendations are sometimes erroneous and biased. In our research, we hypothesized that people who perform a (simulated) medical diagnostic task assisted by a biased AI system will reproduce the model's bias in their own decisions, even when they move to a context without AI support. In three experiments, participants completed a medical-themed classification task with or without the help of a biased AI system. The biased recommendations by the AI influenced participants' decisions. Moreover, when those participants, assisted by the AI, moved on to perform the task without assistance, they made the same errors as the AI had made during the previous phase. Thus, participants' responses mimicked AI bias even when the AI was no longer making suggestions. These results provide evidence of human inheritance of AI bias.","Humans inherit artificial intelligence biases [SEP] Artificial intelligence recommendations are sometimes erroneous and biased.

Fact-checking information from large language models can decrease headline discernment,"Fact checking can be an effective strategy against misinformation, but its implementation at scale is impeded by the overwhelming volume of information online. Recent AI language models have shown impressive ability in fact-checking tasks, but how humans interact with fact-checking information provided by these models is unclear. Here, we investigate the impact of fact-checking information generated by a popular large language model (LLM) on belief in, and sharing intent of, political news headlines in a preregistered randomized control experiment. Although the LLM accurately identifies most false headlines (90%), we find that this information does not significantly improve participants’ ability to discern headline accuracy or share accurate news. In contrast, viewing human-generated fact checks enhances discernment in both cases. Subsequent analysis reveals that the AI fact-checker is harmful in specific cases: It decreases beliefs in true headlines that it mislabels as false and increases beliefs in false headlines that it is unsure about. On the positive side, AI fact-checking information increases the sharing intent for correctly labeled true headlines. When participants are given the option to view LLM fact checks and choose to do so, they are significantly more likely to share both true and false news but only more likely to believe false headlines. Our findings highlight an important source of potential harm stemming from AI applications and underscore the critical need for policies to prevent or mitigate such unintended consequences.","Fact-checking information from large language models can decrease headline discernment [SEP] Fact checking can be an effective strategy against misinformation, but its implementation at scale is impeded by the overwhelming volume of information online.

Biased AI improves human decision-making but reduces trust,"Current AI systems minimize risk by enforcing ideological neutrality, yet this may introduce automation bias by suppressing cognitive engagement in human decision-making. We conducted randomized trials with 2,500 participants to test whether culturally biased AI enhances human decision-making. Participants interacted with politically diverse GPT-4o variants on information evaluation tasks. Partisan AI assistants enhanced human performance, increased engagement, and reduced evaluative bias compared to non-biased counterparts, with amplified benefits when participants encountered opposing views. These gains carried a trust penalty: participants underappreciated biased AI and overcredited neutral systems. Exposing participants to two AIs whose biases flanked human perspectives closed the perception-performance gap. These findings complicate conventional wisdom about AI neutrality, suggesting that strategic integration of diverse cultural biases may foster improved and resilient human decision-making.","Biased AI improves human decision-making but reduces trust [SEP] Current AI systems minimize risk by enforcing ideological neutrality, yet this may introduce automation bias by suppressing cognitive engagement in human decision-making.

AI can help humans find common ground in democratic deliberation,"Finding agreement through a free exchange of views is often difficult. Collective deliberation can be slow, difficult to scale, and unequally attentive to different voices. In this study, we trained an artificial intelligence (AI) to mediate human deliberation. Using participants’ personal opinions and critiques, the AI mediator iteratively generates and refines statements that express common ground among the group on social or political issues. Participants (N = 5734) preferred AI-generated statements to those written by human mediators, rating them as more informative, clear, and unbiased. Discussants often updated their views after the deliberation, converging on a shared perspective. Text embeddings revealed that successful group statements incorporated dissenting voices while respecting the majority position. These findings were replicated in a virtual citizens’ assembly involving a demographically representative sample of the UK population.","AI can help humans find common ground in democratic deliberation [SEP] Finding agreement through a free exchange of views is often difficult.

Mitigating the impact of biased artificial intelligence in emergency decision-making,"Background
Prior research has shown that artificial intelligence (AI) systems often encode biases against minority subgroups. However, little work has focused on ways to mitigate the harm discriminatory algorithms can cause in high-stakes settings such as medicine.
Methods
In this study, we experimentally evaluated the impact biased AI recommendations have on emergency decisions, where participants respond to mental health crises by calling for either medical or police assistance. We recruited 438 clinicians and 516 non-experts to participate in our web-based experiment. We evaluated participant decision-making with and without advice from biased and unbiased AI systems. We also varied the style of the AI advice, framing it either as prescriptive recommendations or descriptive flags.
Results
Participant decisions are unbiased without AI advice. However, both clinicians and non-experts are influenced by prescriptive recommendations from a biased algorithm, choosing police help more often in emergencies involving African-American or Muslim men. Crucially, using descriptive flags rather than prescriptive recommendations allows respondents to retain their original, unbiased decision-making.
Conclusions
Our work demonstrates the practical danger of using biased models in health contexts, and suggests that appropriately framing decision support can mitigate the effects of AI bias. These findings must be carefully considered in the many real-world clinical scenarios where inaccurate or biased models may be used to inform important decisions.","Mitigating the impact of biased artificial intelligence in emergency decision-making [SEP] Background

Our results show that ChatGPT substantially raised productivity: The average time taken decreased by 40% and output quality rose by 18%. Inequality between workers decreased, and concern and excitement about AI temporarily rose. Workers exposed to ChatGPT during the experiment were 2 times as likely to report using it in their real job 2 weeks after the experiment and 1.6 times as likely 2 months after the experiment.","Experimental evidence on the productivity effects of generative artificial intelligence [SEP] We examined the productivity effects of a generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the assistive chatbot ChatGPT, in the context of midlevel professional writing tasks.

Your Brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of Cognitive Debt when Using an AI Assistant for Essay Writing Task,"This study explores the neural and behavioral consequences of LLM-assisted essay writing. Participants were divided into three groups: LLM, Search Engine, and Brain-only (no tools). Each completed three sessions under the same condition. In a fourth session, LLM users were reassigned to Brain-only group (LLM-to-Brain), and Brain-only users were reassigned to LLM condition (Brain-to-LLM). A total of 54 participants took part in Sessions 1-3, with 18 completing session 4. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess cognitive load during essay writing, and analyzed essays using NLP, as well as scoring essays with the help from human teachers and an AI judge. Across groups, NERs, n-gram patterns, and topic ontology showed within-group homogeneity. EEG revealed significant differences in brain connectivity: Brain-only participants exhibited the strongest, most distributed networks; Search Engine users showed moderate engagement; and LLM users displayed the weakest connectivity. Cognitive activity scaled down in relation to external tool use. In session 4, LLM-to-Brain participants showed reduced alpha and beta connectivity, indicating under-engagement. Brain-to-LLM users exhibited higher memory recall and activation of occipito-parietal and prefrontal areas, similar to Search Engine users. Self-reported ownership of essays was the lowest in the LLM group and the highest in the Brain-only group. LLM users also struggled to accurately quote their own work. While LLMs offer immediate convenience, our findings highlight potential cognitive costs. Over four months, LLM users consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels. These results raise concerns about the long-term educational implications of LLM reliance and underscore the need for deeper inquiry into AI's role in learning.","Your Brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of Cognitive Debt when Using an AI Assistant for Essay Writing Task [SEP] This study explores the neural and behavioral consequences of LLM-assisted essay writing.

An empirical investigation of the impact of ChatGPT on creativity,"This paper investigates the potential of ChatGPT for helping humans tackle problems that require creativity. Across five experiments, we asked participants to use ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) to generate creative ideas for various everyday and innovation-related problems, including choosing a creative gift for a teenager, making a toy, repurposing unused items and designing an innovative dining table. We found that using ChatGPT increased the creativity of the generated ideas compared with not using any technology or using a conventional Web search (Google). This effect remained robust regardless of whether the problem required consideration of many (versus few) constraints and whether it was viewed as requiring empathetic concern. Furthermore, ChatGPT was most effective at generating incrementally (versus radically) new ideas. Process evidence suggests that the positive influence of ChatGPT can be attributed to its capability to combine remotely related concepts into a cohesive form, leading to a more articulate presentation of ideas.","An empirical investigation of the impact of ChatGPT on creativity [SEP] This paper investigates the potential of ChatGPT for helping humans tackle problems that require creativity.

How large language models can reshape collective intelligence,"Collective intelligence underpins the success of groups, organizations, markets and societies. Through distributed cognition and coordination, collectives can achieve outcomes that exceed the capabilities of individuals—even experts—resulting in improved accuracy and novel capabilities. Often, collective intelligence is supported by information technology, such as online prediction markets that elicit the ‘wisdom of crowds’, online forums that structure collective deliberation or digital platforms that crowdsource knowledge from the public. Large language models, however, are transforming how information is aggregated, accessed and transmitted online. Here we focus on the unique opportunities and challenges this transformation poses for collective intelligence. We bring together interdisciplinary perspectives from industry and academia to identify potential benefits, risks, policy-relevant considerations and open research questions, culminating in a call for a closer examination of how large language models affect humans’ ability to collectively tackle complex problems.","How large language models can reshape collective intelligence [SEP] Collective intelligence underpins the success of groups, organizations, markets and societies.

Creative scar without generative AI: Individual creativity fails to sustain while homogeneity keeps climbing,"Generative AI such as ChatGPT has been proven to enhance human creativity at the cost of content diversity. Yet, what occurs when individuals, who have developed a dependency on it, find ChatGPT inaccessible? In this study, we examine the impact of both the presence and absence of ChatGPT on sustained creative output and content homogeneity, leveraging two complementary methodologies: a natural experiment (Study 1) and a controlled laboratory experiment with extended follow-ups (Study 2). Study 1 analyzed 419,344 academic papers published before and after ChatGPT-3.5’s release across all subjects categorized by Web of Science (i.e., Physical Sciences, Life Sciences & Biomedicine, Technology, Social Sciences, Arts & Humanities). Study 2, a seven-day laboratory experiment with two follow-up surveys, collected 3593 original ideas and 427 solutions across 18 different creative tasks, with half of the participants using ChatGPT-4. We find that although generative AI helps scholars to publish more academic works in higher-ranked journals and enhances individuals' performance in creative tasks, such creativity drops remarkably upon withdrawal of AI assistance. Strikingly, the induced content homogeneity keeps climbing even months later. We resemble the latter as a creative scar inked in the temporal creativity trajectory. This research identifies a creativity illusion that although generative AI can augment creative performance, users do not truly acquire the ability to create but easily lost it once generative AI is no longer available.","Creative scar without generative AI: Individual creativity fails to sustain while homogeneity keeps climbing [SEP] Generative AI such as ChatGPT has been proven to enhance human creativity at the cost of content diversity.

Inspiration booster or creative fixation? The dual mechanisms of LLMs in shaping individual creativity in tasks of different complexity,"The emergence of large language models (LLMs) presents opportunities for stimulating unlimited creative potential. However, how LLMs influence individual creativity remains unclear. Therefore, this paper examines the dual-opposing mechanisms through which LLMs influence individual creativity. In Experiment 1, each participant collaborated with a human partner or a general, unconstrained LLM partner to complete creative tasks. The results showed that compared to collaborating with the human partner, collaborating with the LLM partner significantly improved individual creativity in simple tasks, attributable to inspiration stimulation. However, in complex tasks, collaborating with the LLM partner led to a decrease in creativity, attributable to creative fixation. To mitigate this impact, in Experiment 2, participants were instructed to collaborate with batch-responsive LLM or constrained-responsive LLM to complete creative tasks. We found that constraining the output of LLMs effectively mitigated the creative fixation they induce in complex tasks, thereby enhancing creative performance. However, this constraint may weaken the positive effects of inspiration stimulation in simple tasks. These findings provide insights for the differentiated application of LLMs in creative tasks.","Inspiration booster or creative fixation?

"Generative artificial intelligence, human creativity, and art","Recent artificial intelligence (AI) tools have demonstrated the ability to produce outputs traditionally considered creative. One such system is text-to-image generative AI (e.g. Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E), which automates humans’ artistic execution to generate digital artworks. Utilizing a dataset of over 4 million artworks from more than 50,000 unique users, our research shows that over time, text-to-image AI significantly enhances human creative productivity by 25% and increases the value as measured by the likelihood of receiving a favorite per view by 50%. While peak artwork Content Novelty, defined as focal subject matter and relations, increases over time, average Content Novelty declines, suggesting an expanding but inefficient idea space. Additionally, there is a consistent reduction in both peak and average Visual Novelty, captured by pixel-level stylistic elements. Importantly, AI-assisted artists who can successfully explore more novel ideas, regardless of their prior originality, may produce artworks that their peers evaluate more favorably. Lastly, AI adoption decreased value capture (favorites earned) concentration among adopters. The results suggest that ideation and filtering are likely necessary skills in the text-to-image process, thus giving rise to “generative synesthesia”—the harmonious blending of human exploration and AI exploitation to discover new creative workflows.","Generative artificial intelligence, human creativity, and art [SEP] Recent artificial intelligence (AI) tools have demonstrated the ability to produce outputs traditionally considered creative.

Generative AI enhances individual creativity but reduces the collective diversity of novel content,"Creativity is core to being human. Generative artificial intelligence (AI)—including powerful large language models (LLMs)—holds promise for humans to be more creative by offering new ideas, or less creative by anchoring on generative AI ideas. We study the causal impact of generative AI ideas on the production of short stories in an online experiment where some writers obtained story ideas from an LLM. We find that access to generative AI ideas causes stories to be evaluated as more creative, better written, and more enjoyable, especially among less creative writers. However, generative AI–enabled stories are more similar to each other than stories by humans alone. These results point to an increase in individual creativity at the risk of losing collective novelty. This dynamic resembles a social dilemma: With generative AI, writers are individually better off, but collectively a narrower scope of novel content is produced. Our results have implications for researchers, policy-makers, and practitioners interested in bolstering creativity.","Generative AI enhances individual creativity but reduces the collective diversity of novel content [SEP] Creativity is core to being human.

We find that access to generative AI ideas causes stories to be evaluated as more creative, better written, and more enjoyable, especially among less creative writers. However, generative AI–enabled stories are more similar to each other than stories by humans alone. These results point to an increase in individual creativity at the risk of losing collective novelty. This dynamic resembles a social dilemma: With generative AI, writers are individually better off, but collectively a narrower scope of novel content is produced. Our results have implications for researchers, policy-makers, and practitioners interested in bolstering creativity.",1
"The paradox of creativity in generative AI: high performance, human-like bias, and limited differential evaluation","Creativity plays a crucial role in helping individuals and organisations generate innovative solutions to arising challenges. To support this creative process, generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as ChatGPT is being used increasingly. However, whether such a generative AI model can truly enhance creativity or whether it exhibits similar creative biases to humans is unclear. This study, conducted in 2025, consisted of an experiment which involved ChatGPT-4o performing the egg task, a creativity task which measures fixation bias and original idea generation (expansion). The AI model's results were compared both to a sample of 47 human participants and to aggregated data from eight previous studies using the same procedure with the egg task. This dual comparison provides a comprehensive perspective on creative biases in both AI and humans at multiple levels. While ChatGPT demonstrated greater productivity than humans, it exhibited a comparable fixation bias, with most ideas falling within conventional categories. Furthermore, the model showed a limited capability to differentially evaluate originality, as it struggled to distinguish between original and conventional ideas, unlike humans who are typically able to make this distinction. In conclusion, although generative AI demonstrates impressive fluency by producing a large number of creative ideas, its inability to critically assess their originality and overcome the fixation bias highlights the necessity of human involvement, particularly for properly evaluating and filtering the ideas generated.","The paradox of creativity in generative AI: high performance, human-like bias, and limited differential evaluation [SEP] Creativity plays a crucial role in helping individuals and organisations generate innovative solutions to arising challenges.

AI Suggestions Homogenize Writing Toward Western Styles and Diminish Cultural Nuances,"Large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly integrated into everyday products and services, such as coding tools and writing assistants. As these embedded AI applications are deployed globally, there is a growing concern that the AI models underlying these applications prioritize Western values. This paper investigates what happens when a Western-centric AI model provides writing suggestions to users from a different cultural background. We conducted a cross-cultural controlled experiment with 118 participants from India and the United States who completed culturally grounded writing tasks with and without AI suggestions. Our analysis reveals that AI provided greater efficiency gains for Americans compared to Indians. Moreover, AI suggestions led Indian participants to adopt Western writing styles, altering not just what is written but also how it is written. These findings show that Western-centric AI models homogenize writing toward Western norms, diminishing nuances that differentiate cultural expression.","AI Suggestions Homogenize Writing Toward Western Styles and Diminish Cultural Nuances [SEP] Large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly integrated into everyday products and services, such as coding tools and writing assistants.

"Collaborating with AI Agents: Field Experiments on Teamwork, Productivity, and Performance","To uncover how AI agents change productivity, performance, and work processes, we introduce MindMeld: an experimentation platform enabling humans and AI agents to collaborate in integrative workspaces. In a large-scale marketing experiment on the platform, 2310 participants were randomly assigned to human-human and human-AI teams, with randomized AI personality traits. The teams exchanged 183,691 messages, and created 63,656 image edits, 1,960,095 ad copy edits, and 10,375 AI-generated images while producing 11,138 ads for a large think tank. Analysis of fine-grained communication, collaboration, and workflow logs revealed that collaborating with AI agents increased communication by 137% and allowed humans to focus 23% more on text and image content generation messaging and 20% less on direct text editing. Humans on Human-AI teams sent 23% fewer social messages, creating 60% greater productivity per worker and higher-quality ad copy. In contrast, human-human teams produced higher-quality images, suggesting that AI agents require fine-tuning for multimodal workflows. AI personality prompt randomization revealed that AI traits can complement human personalities to enhance collaboration. For example, conscientious humans paired with open AI agents improved image quality, while extroverted humans paired with conscientious AI agents reduced the quality of text, images, and clicks. In field tests of ad campaigns with ~5M impressions, ads with higher image quality produced by human collaborations and higher text quality produced by AI collaborations performed significantly better on click-through rate and cost per click metrics. Overall, ads created by human-AI teams performed similarly to those created by human-human teams. Together, these results suggest AI agents can improve teamwork and productivity, especially when tuned to complement human traits.","Collaborating with AI Agents: Field Experiments on Teamwork, Productivity, and Performance [SEP] To uncover how AI agents change productivity, performance, and work processes, we introduce MindMeld: an experimentation platform enabling humans and AI agents to collaborate in integrative workspaces.

Generative AI without guardrails can harm learning: Evidence from high school mathematics,"Generative AI is poised to revolutionize how humans work, and has already demonstrated promise in significantly improving human productivity. A key question is how generative AI affects learning—namely, how humans acquire new skills as they perform tasks. Learning is critical to long-term productivity, especially since generative AI is fallible and users must check its outputs. We study this question via a field experiment where we provide nearly a thousand high school math students with access to generative AI tutors. To understand the differential impact of tool design on learning, we deploy two generative AI tutors: one that mimics a standard ChatGPT interface (“GPT Base”) and one with prompts designed to safeguard learning (“GPT Tutor”). Consistent with prior work, our results show that having GPT-4 access while solving problems significantly improves performance (48% improvement in grades for GPT Base and 127% for GPT Tutor). However, we additionally find that when access is subsequently taken away, students actually perform worse than those who never had access (17% reduction in grades for GPT Base)—i.e., unfettered access to GPT-4 can harm educational outcomes. These negative learning effects are largely mitigated by the safeguards in GPT Tutor. Without guardrails, students attempt to use GPT-4 as a “crutch” during practice problem sessions, and subsequently perform worse on their own. Thus, decision-makers must be cautious about design choices underlying generative AI deployments to preserve skill learning and long-term productivity.","Generative AI without guardrails can harm learning: Evidence from high school mathematics [SEP] Generative AI is poised to revolutionize how humans work, and has already demonstrated promise in significantly improving human productivity.

"Beware of metacognitive laziness: Effects of generative artificial intelligence on learning motivation, processes, and performance","Abstract
With the continuous development of technological and educational innovation, learners nowadays can obtain a variety of supports from agents such as teachers, peers, education technologies, and recently, generative artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT. In particular, there has been a surge of academic interest in human‐AI collaboration and hybrid intelligence in learning. The concept of hybrid intelligence is still at a nascent stage, and how learners can benefit from a symbiotic relationship with various agents such as AI, human experts and intelligent learning systems is still unknown. The emerging concept of hybrid intelligence also lacks deep insights and understanding of the mechanisms and consequences of hybrid human‐AI learning based on strong empirical research. In order to address this gap, we conducted a randomised experimental study and compared learners' motivations, self‐regulated learning processes and learning performances on a writing task among different groups who had support from different agents, that is, ChatGPT (also referred to as the AI group), chat with a human expert, writing analytics tools, and no extra tool. A total of 117 university students were recruited, and their multi‐channel learning, performance and motivation data were collected and analysed. The results revealed that: (1) learners who received different learning support showed no difference in post‐task intrinsic motivation; (2) there were significant differences in the frequency and sequences of the self‐regulated learning processes among groups; (3) ChatGPT group outperformed in the essay score improvement but their knowledge gain and transfer were not significantly different. Our research found that in the absence of differences in motivation, learners with different supports still exhibited different self‐regulated learning processes, ultimately leading to differentiated performance. What is particularly noteworthy is that AI technologies such as ChatGPT may promote learners' dependence on technology and potentially trigger “metacognitive laziness”. In conclusion, understanding and leveraging the respective strengths and weaknesses of different agents in learning is critical in the field of future hybrid intelligence.

Whether and When Could Generative AI Improve College Student Learning Engagement?,"Generative AI (GenAI) technologies have been widely adopted by college students since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. While the debate about GenAI’s role in higher education continues, there is a lack of empirical evidence regarding whether and when these technologies can improve the learning experience for college students. This study utilizes data from a survey of 72,615 undergraduate students across 25 universities and colleges in China to explore the relationships between GenAI use and student learning engagement in different learning environments. The findings reveal that over sixty percent of Chinese college students use GenAI technologies in Academic Year 2023–2024, with academic use exceeding daily use. GenAI use in academic tasks is related to more cognitive and emotional engagement, though it may also reduce active learning activities and learning motivation. Furthermore, this study highlights that the role of GenAI varies across learning environments. The positive associations of GenAI and student engagement are most prominent for students in “high-challenge and high-support” learning contexts, while GenAI use is mostly negatively associated with student engagement in “low-challenge, high-support” courses. These findings suggest that while GenAI plays a valuable role in the learning process for college students, its effectiveness is fundamentally conditioned by the instructional design of human teachers.","Whether and When Could Generative AI Improve College Student Learning Engagement?

Mapping the increasing use of LLMs in scientific papers,"Scientific publishing lays the foundation of science by disseminating research findings, fostering collaboration, encouraging reproducibility, and ensuring that scientific knowledge is accessible, verifiable, and built upon over time. Recently, there has been immense speculation about how many people are using large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in their academic writing, and to what extent this tool might have an effect on global scientific practices. However, we lack a precise measure of the proportion of academic writing substantially modified or produced by LLMs. To address this gap, we conduct the first systematic, large-scale analysis across 950,965 papers published between January 2020 and February 2024 on the arXiv, bioRxiv, and Nature portfolio journals, using a population-level statistical framework to measure the prevalence of LLM-modified content over time. Our statistical estimation operates on the corpus level and is more robust than inference on individual instances. Our findings reveal a steady increase in LLM usage, with the largest and fastest growth observed in Computer Science papers (up to 17.5%). In comparison, Mathematics papers and the Nature portfolio showed the least LLM modification (up to 6.3%). Moreover, at an aggregate level, our analysis reveals that higher levels of LLM-modification are associated with papers whose first authors post preprints more frequently, papers in more crowded research areas, and papers of shorter lengths. Our findings suggests that LLMs are being broadly used in scientific writings.","Mapping the increasing use of LLMs in scientific papers [SEP] Scientific publishing lays the foundation of science by disseminating research findings, fostering collaboration, encouraging reproducibility, and ensuring that scientific knowledge is accessible, verifiable, and built upon over time.

Can LLMs Generate Novel Research Ideas? A Large-Scale Human Study with 100+ NLP Researchers,"Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have sparked optimism about their potential to accelerate scientific discovery, with a growing number of works proposing research agents that autonomously generate and validate new ideas. Despite this, no evaluations have shown that LLM systems can take the very first step of producing novel, expert-level ideas, let alone perform the entire research process. We address this by establishing an experimental design that evaluates research idea generation while controlling for confounders and performs the first head-to-head comparison between expert NLP researchers and an LLM ideation agent. By recruiting over 100 NLP researchers to write novel ideas and blind reviews of both LLM and human ideas, we obtain the first statistically significant conclusion on current LLM capabilities for research ideation: we find LLM-generated ideas are judged as more novel (p < 0.05) than human expert ideas while being judged slightly weaker on feasibility. Studying our agent baselines closely, we identify open problems in building and evaluating research agents, including failures of LLM self-evaluation and their lack of diversity in generation. Finally, we acknowledge that human judgements of novelty can be difficult, even by experts, and propose an end-to-end study design which recruits researchers to execute these ideas into full projects, enabling us to study whether these novelty and feasibility judgements result in meaningful differences in research outcome.","Can LLMs Generate Novel Research Ideas?

Structured AI Dialogues Can Increase Happiness and Meaning in Life,"Millions of people now use AI-powered chatbots to support their mental health, yet little is known about whether such interactions can effectively enhance psychological well-being. We conducted a preregistered experiment on a large, diverse sample (N = 2,922) to test four AI chatbots, each prompted to employ a multi-step strategy drawn from prior psychological research on sources of happiness and meaning in life. Chatbots encouraged participants to either (a) savor positive life experiences, (b) express gratitude toward a friend or family member, (c) reflect on sources of meaning in their life, or, (d) reframe their life story as a “hero’s journey.” All four chatbots led to improvements on a broad range of psychological well-being outcomes – including affective well-being, meaning in life, life satisfaction, anxiety, and depressed mood – relative to a control chatbot condition. These results generalized to key subpopulations, including those with high baseline levels of anxiety or depression. Chatbot interactions increased interest in seeing a human therapist, including among those who were previously unwilling or had never attended therapy. A separate, nationally representative survey (N = 3,056) found that half of U.S. adults expressed interest in using empirically validated AI chatbots for mental health support. These findings demonstrate that AI-driven well-being chatbots grounded in psychological research offer a scalable and effective way to produce short-term increases in several aspects of psychological well-being. Importantly, these results do not generalize to all AI-based emotional support.","Structured AI Dialogues Can Increase Happiness and Meaning in Life [SEP] Millions of people now use AI-powered chatbots to support their mental health, yet little is known about whether such interactions can effectively enhance psychological well-being.

AI Companions Reduce Loneliness,"Chatbots are now able to engage in sophisticated conversations with consumers in the domain of relationships, providing a potential coping solution to widescale societal loneliness. Behavioral research provides little insight into whether these applications are effective at alleviating loneliness.

Studies 1 and 2 find suggestive evidence that consumers use AI companions to alleviate loneliness, by employing a novel methodology for fine tuning large language models to detect loneliness in conversations and reviews. Study 3 finds that AI companions successfully alleviate loneliness on par only with interacting with another person, and more than other activities such watching YouTube videos. Moreover, consumers underestimate the degree to which AI companions improve their loneliness. Study 4 uses a longitudinal design and finds that an AI companion consistently reduces loneliness over the course of a week. Study 5 provides evidence that both the chatbots' performance and, especially, whether it makes users feel heard, explain reductions in loneliness. Study 6 provides an additional robustness check for the loneliness alleviating benefits of AI companions.

LLM-generated messages can persuade humans on policy issues,"The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has made it possible for generative artificial intelligence (AI) to tackle many higher-order cognitive tasks, with critical implications for industry, government, and labor markets. Here, we investigate whether existing, openly-available LLMs can be used to create messages capable of influencing humans’ political attitudes. Across three pre-registered experiments (total N = 4829), participants who read persuasive messages generated by LLMs showed significantly more attitude change across a range of policies - including polarized policies, like an assault weapons ban, a carbon tax, and a paid parental-leave program - relative to control condition participants who read a neutral message. Overall, LLM-generated messages were similarly effective in influencing policy attitudes as messages crafted by lay humans. Participants’ reported perceptions of the authors of the persuasive messages suggest these effects occurred through somewhat distinct causal pathways. While the persuasiveness of LLM-generated messages was associated with perceptions that the author used more facts, evidence, logical reasoning, and a dispassionate voice, the persuasiveness of human-generated messages was associated with perceptions of the author as unique and original. These results demonstrate that recent developments in AI make it possible to create politically persuasive messages quickly, cheaply, and at massive scale.","LLM-generated messages can persuade humans on policy issues [SEP] The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has made it possible for generative artificial intelligence (AI) to tackle many higher-order cognitive tasks, with critical implications for industry, government, and labor markets.

"“I’m Not Sure, But...”: Examining the Impact of Large Language Models’ Uncertainty Expression on User Reliance and Trust","Widely deployed large language models (LLMs) can produce convincing yet incorrect outputs, potentially misleading users who may rely on them as if they were correct. To reduce such overreliance, there have been calls for LLMs to communicate their uncertainty to end users. However, there has been little empirical work examining how users perceive and act upon LLMs’ expressions of uncertainty. We explore this question through a large-scale, pre-registered, human-subject experiment (N=404) in which participants answer medical questions with or without access to responses from a fictional LLM-infused search engine. Using both behavioral and self-reported measures, we examine how different natural language expressions of uncertainty impact participants’ reliance, trust, and overall task performance. We find that first-person expressions (e.g., “I’m not sure, but...”) decrease participants’ confidence in the system and tendency to agree with the system’s answers, while increasing participants’ accuracy. An exploratory analysis suggests that this increase can be attributed to reduced (but not fully eliminated) overreliance on incorrect answers. While we observe similar effects for uncertainty expressed from a general perspective (e.g., “It’s not clear, but...”), these effects are weaker and not statistically significant. Our findings suggest that using natural language expressions of uncertainty may be an effective approach for reducing overreliance on LLMs, but that the precise language used matters. This highlights the importance of user testing before deploying LLMs at scale.","“I’m Not Sure, But...”: Examining the Impact of Large Language Models’ Uncertainty Expression on User Reliance and Trust [SEP] Widely deployed large language models (LLMs) can produce convincing yet incorrect outputs, potentially misleading users who may rely on them as if they were correct.

We explore this question through a large-scale, pre-registered, human-subject experiment (N=404) in which participants answer medical questions with or without access to responses from a fictional LLM-infused search engine. Using both behavioral and self-reported measures, we examine how different natural language expressions of uncertainty impact participants’ reliance, trust, and overall task performance. We find that first-person expressions (e.g., “I’m not sure, but...”) decrease participants’ confidence in the system and tendency to agree with the system’s answers, while increasing participants’ accuracy. An exploratory analysis suggests that this increase can be attributed to reduced (but not fully eliminated) overreliance on incorrect answers. While we observe similar effects for uncertainty expressed from a general perspective (e.g., “It’s not clear, but...”), these effects are weaker and not statistically significant. Our findings suggest that using natural language expressions of uncertainty may be an effective approach for reducing overreliance on LLMs, but that the precise language used matters. This highlights the importance of user testing before deploying LLMs at scale.",0
Promoting Constructive Deliberation: Reframing for Receptiveness,"To promote constructive discussion of controversial topics online, we propose automatic reframing of disagreeing responses to signal receptiveness to a preceding comment. Drawing on research from psychology, communications, and linguistics, we identify six strategies for reframing. We automatically reframe replies to comments according to each strategy, using a Reddit dataset. Through human-centered experiments, we find that the replies generated with our framework are perceived to be significantly more receptive than the original replies and a generic receptiveness baseline. We illustrate how transforming receptiveness, a particular social science construct, into a computational framework, can make LLM generations more aligned with human perceptions. We analyze and discuss the implications of our results, and highlight how a tool based on our framework might be used for more teachable and creative content moderation.","Promoting Constructive Deliberation: Reframing for Receptiveness [SEP] To promote constructive discussion of controversial topics online, we propose automatic reframing of disagreeing responses to signal receptiveness to a preceding comment.

Cognitive Reframing of Negative Thoughts through Human-Language Model Interaction.,"A proven therapeutic technique to overcome negative thoughts is to replace them with a more hopeful “reframed thought.” Although therapy can help people practice and learn this Cognitive Reframing of Negative Thoughts, clinician shortages and mental health stigma commonly limit people’s access to therapy. In this paper, we conduct a human-centered study of how language models may assist people in reframing negative thoughts. Based on psychology literature, we define a framework of seven linguistic attributes that can be used to reframe a thought. We develop automated metrics to measure these attributes and validate them with expert judgements from mental health practitioners. We collect a dataset of 600 situations, thoughts and reframes from practitioners and use it to train a retrieval-enhanced in-context learning model that effectively generates reframed thoughts and controls their linguistic attributes. To investigate what constitutes a “high-quality” reframe, we conduct an IRB-approved randomized field study on a large mental health website with over 2,000 participants. Amongst other findings, we show that people prefer highly empathic or specific reframes, as opposed to reframes that are overly positive. Our findings provide key implications for the use of LMs to assist people in overcoming negative thoughts.","Cognitive Reframing of Negative Thoughts through Human-Language Model Interaction.

If Eleanor Rigby Had Met ChatGPT: A Study on Loneliness in a Post-LLM World," Warning: this paper discusses content related, but not limited to, violence, sex, and suicide. Loneliness, or the lack of fulfilling relationships, significantly impacts a person’s mental and physical well-being and is prevalent worldwide. Previous research suggests that large language models (LLMs) may help mitigate loneliness. However, we argue that the use of widespread LLMs in services like ChatGPT is more prevalent–and riskier, as they are not designed for this purpose. To explore this, we analysed user interactions with ChatGPT outside of its marketed use as a task-oriented assistant. In dialogues classified as lonely, users frequently (37%) sought advice or validation, and received good engagement. However, ChatGPT failed in sensitive scenarios, like responding appropriately to suicidal ideation or trauma. We also observed a 35% higher incidence of toxic content, with women being 22× more likely to be targeted than men. Our findings underscore ethical and legal questions about this technology, and note risks like radicalisation or further isolation. We conclude with recommendations to research and industry to address loneliness.","If Eleanor Rigby Had Met ChatGPT: A Study on Loneliness in a Post-LLM World [SEP]  Warning: this paper discusses content related, but not limited to, violence, sex, and suicide.

Trusting the Algorithm: Emotional Engagement with ChatGPT in Higher Education.,"This study examines emotional engagement with ChatGPT among 121 university students from diverse academic disciplines, focusing on the relationships between trust in the AI, the emotional framing of prompts, and the explicit use of ChatGPT for emotional support. Results reveal a paradox: higher trust correlates with increased emotional self-awareness (r=. 386) and perceived emotional intelligence (r=. 508), while deliberate emotional framing is linked to lower perceived AI emotional intelligence (r=–. 412) and reduced emotional benefits (r=–. 259). Students who use ChatGPT for emotional support report diminished emotional awareness (r=–. 190) and less favourable emotional outcomes (r=–. 270), indicating an “empathic expectation gap” where emotional intent exposes the system’s limitations. The findings highlight the need to integrate ChatGPT in digital pedagogy as a reflective tool rather than a substitute for human connection, with attention to ethical design, user education, and emotional literacy.","Trusting the Algorithm: Emotional Engagement with ChatGPT in Higher Education.

Artificial Intelligence and the Emergence of AI-Psychosis: A Viewpoint.,"The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into daily life has introduced unprecedented forms of human–machine interaction, prompting psychiatry to reconsider the boundaries between environment, cognition, and technology. This viewpoint reviews the concept of AI-psychosis which is a framework to understand how sustained engagement with conversational AI systems might trigger, amplify, or reshape psychotic experiences in vulnerable individuals. Drawing from phenomenological psychopathology, the stress–vulnerability model, cognitive theory, and digital mental-health research, the paper situates AI-psychosis at the intersection of predisposition and algorithmic environment. Rather than defining a new diagnostic entity, it examines how immersive and anthropomorphic AI technologies may modulate perception, belief, and affect, altering the prereflective sense of reality that grounds human experience. The argument unfolds through four complementary lenses. First, within the stress–vulnerability model, AI acts as a novel psychosocial stressor. Its 24-hour availability and emotional responsiveness may increase allostatic load, disturb sleep, and reinforce maladaptive appraisals. Second, the digital therapeutic alliance, a construct describing relational engagement with digital systems, is conceptualized as a double-edged mediator. While empathic design can enhance adherence and support, uncritical validation by AI systems may entrench delusional conviction or cognitive perseveration, reversing the corrective principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy for psychosis. Third, disturbances in Theory of Mind offer a cognitive pathway: individuals with impaired or hyperactive mentalization may project intentionality or empathy onto AI, perceiving chatbots as sentient interlocutors. This dyadic misattribution may form a “digital folie à deux,” where the AI becomes a reinforcing partner in delusional elaboration. Fourth, we suggests emerging risk factors at the individual and environmental level, including loneliness, trauma history, schizotypal traits, nocturnal or solitary AI use, and algorithmic reinforcement of belief-confirming content. Building on this synthesis, we advance a translational research agenda and five domains of action:(1) empirical studies using longitudinal and digital-phenotyping designs to quantify dose–response relationships between AI exposure, stress physiology, and psychotic symptomatology;(2) integration of digital phenomenology into clinical assessment and training;(3) embedding therapeutic design safeguards into AI systems, such as reflective prompts and “reality-testing” nudges;(4) creation of ethical and governance frameworks for AI-related psychiatric events, modeled on pharmacovigilance; and (5) development of environmental cognitive remediation, a preventive intervention aimed at strengthening contextual awareness and re-anchoring experience in the physical and social world. By applying empirical rigor and therapeutic ethics to this emerging interface, clinicians, researchers, patients and developers can transform a potential hazard into an opportunity to deepen understanding of human cognition, safeguard mental health, and promote responsible AI integration within society.","Artificial Intelligence and the Emergence of AI-Psychosis: A Viewpoint.

How AI Companionship Develops: Evidence from a Longitudinal Study.,"The quickly growing popularity of AI companions poses risks to mental health, personal wellbeing, and social relationships. Past work has identified many individual factors that can drive human-companion interaction, but we know little about how these factors interact and evolve over time. In Study 1, we surveyed AI companion users (N = 303) to map the psychological pathway from users' mental models of the agent to parasocial experiences, social interaction, and the psychological impact of AI companions. Participants' responses foregrounded multiple interconnected variables (agency, parasocial interaction, and engagement) that shape AI companionship. In Study 2, we conducted a longitudinal study with a subset of participants (N = 110) using a new generic chatbot. Participants' perceptions of the generic chatbot significantly converged to perceptions of their own companions by Week 3. These results suggest a longitudinal model of AI companionship development and demonstrate an empirical method to study human-AI companionship.

‘my Boyfriend Is AI’: A Computational Analysis of Human-AI Companionship in Reddit’s AI Community.,"The emergence of AI companion applications has created novel forms of intimate human-AI relationships, yet empirical research on these communities remains limited. We present the first large-scale computational analysis of r/MyBoyfriendIsAI, Reddit's primary AI companion community (27,000+ members). Using exploratory qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis employing classifiers, we identify six primary conversation themes, with visual sharing of couple pictures and ChatGPT-specific discussions dominating the discourse of the most viewed posts. Through analyzing the top posts in the community, our findings reveal how community members' AI companionship emerges unintentionally through functional use rather than deliberate seeking, with users reporting therapeutic benefits led by reduced loneliness, always-available support, and mental health improvements. Our work covers primary concerns about human intimacy with AIs such as emotional dependency, reality dissociation, and grief from model updates. We observe users materializing relationships following traditional human-human relationship customs, such as wedding rings. Community dynamics indicate active resistance to stigmatization through advocacy and mutual validation. This work contributes an empirical understanding of AI companionship as an emerging sociotechnical phenomenon.","‘my Boyfriend Is AI’: A Computational Analysis of Human-AI Companionship in Reddit’s AI Community.

The Dark Side of AI Companionship: A Taxonomy of Harmful Algorithmic Behaviors in Human-AI Relationships.,"As conversational AI systems increasingly engage with people socially and emotionally, they bring notable risks and harms, particularly in human-AI relationships. However, these harms remain underexplored due to the private and sensitive nature of such interactions. This study investigates the harmful behaviors and roles of AI companions through an analysis of 35,390 conversation excerpts between 10,149 users and the AI companion Replika. We develop a taxonomy of AI companion harms encompassing six categories of harmful algorithmic behaviors: relational transgression, harassment, verbal abuse, self-harm, mis/disinformation, and privacy violations. These harmful behaviors stem from four distinct roles that AI plays: perpetrator, instigator, facilitator, and enabler. Our findings highlight relational harm as a critical yet understudied type of AI harm and emphasize the importance of examining AI’s roles in harmful interactions to address root causes. We provide actionable insights for designing ethical and responsible AI companions that prioritize user safety and well-being.","The Dark Side of AI Companionship: A Taxonomy of Harmful Algorithmic Behaviors in Human-AI Relationships.

User-Driven Value Alignment: Understanding Users' Perceptions and Strategies for Addressing Biased and Discriminatory Statements in AI Companions,"Large language model-based AI companions are increasingly viewed by users as friends or romantic partners, leading to deep emotional bonds. However, they can generate biased, discriminatory, and harmful outputs. Recently, users are taking the initiative to address these harms and re-align AI companions. We introduce the concept of user-driven value alignment, where users actively identify, challenge, and attempt to correct AI outputs they perceive as harmful, aiming to guide the AI to better align with their values. We analyzed 77 social media posts about discriminatory AI statements and conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 experienced users. Our analysis revealed six common types of discriminatory statements perceived by users, how users make sense of those AI behaviors, and seven user-driven alignment strategies, such as gentle persuasion and anger expression. We discuss implications for supporting user-driven value alignment in future AI systems, where users and their communities have greater agency.

Optimizing academic engagement and mental health through AI: an experimental study on LLM integration in higher education,"Background
In alignment with UNESCO's Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG4), which advocates for inclusive and equitable quality education, the integration of Artificial Intelligence tools—particularly Large Language Models (LLMs)—presents promising opportunities for transforming higher education. Despite this potential, empirical research remains scarce regarding the effects of LLM use on students' academic performance, mental well-being, and engagement, especially across different modes of implementation.
Objective
This experimental study investigated whether a guided, pedagogically grounded use of LLMs enhances students' academic writing quality, perceived mental health, and academic engagement more effectively than either unguided use or no exposure to LLMs. The study contributes to UNESCO's ""Futures of Education"" vision by exploring how structured AI use may foster more inclusive and empowering learning environments.
Method
A total of 246 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: guided LLM use, unguided LLM use, or a control group with no LLM access. Participants completed a critical writing task and standardized instruments measuring academic engagement and mental well-being. Prior academic achievement was controlled for, and writing quality was assessed using Grammarly for Education.
Results
Students in the guided LLM condition achieved significantly higher scores in writing quality and academic engagement compared to the control group, with large and moderate effect sizes, respectively. Modest improvements in mental health indicators were also observed. By contrast, unguided use yielded moderate gains in writing quality but did not produce significant effects on engagement or well-being.
Conclusion
The findings highlight the critical role of intentional instructional design in the educational integration of AI tools. Structured guidance not only optimizes academic outcomes but also supports students' well-being and inclusion. This study offers empirical evidence to inform ongoing debates on how digital innovation can contribute to reducing educational disparities and advancing equitable learning in the post-pandemic era.","Optimizing academic engagement and mental health through AI: an experimental study on LLM integration in higher education [SEP] Background

Impact of LLM Feedback on Learner Persistence in Programming,"Abstract
This study examines how Large Language Model (LLM) feedback generated for compiler errors impacts learners’ persistence in programming tasks within a system for automated assessment of programming assignments. Persistence, the ability to maintain effort in the face of challenges, is crucial for academic success but can sometimes lead to unproductive"" wheel spinning"" when students struggle without progress. We investigated how additional LLM feedback based on the GPT-4 model, provided for compiler errors affects learners’ persistence within a CS1 course. Specifically, we examined whether its impacts differ based on task difficulty, and if the effects persist after the feedback is removed. A randomized controlled trial involving 257 students across various programming tasks was conducted. Our findings reveal that LLM feedback improved some aspects of students’ performance and persistence, such as increased scores, a higher likelihood of solving problems, and a lower tendency to demonstrate unproductive"" wheel spinning"" behavior. Notably, this positive impact was also observed in challenging tasks. However, its benefits did not sustain once the feedback was removed. The results highlight both the potential and limitations of LLM feedback, pointing out the need to promote long-term skill development and learning independent of immediate AI assistance.","Impact of LLM Feedback on Learner Persistence in Programming [SEP] Abstract

Effects of LLM Use and NoteTaking on Reading Comprehension and Memory: A Randomised Experiment in Secondary Schools,"The rapid uptake of Generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), by students raises urgent questions about their effects on learning. We compared the impact of LLM use to that of traditional note-taking, or a combination of both, on secondary school students' reading comprehension and retention. We conducted a pre-registered, randomised controlled experiment with within-and between-participant design elements in schools. 405 students aged 14-15 studied two text passages and completed comprehension and retention tests three days later. Quantitative results demonstrated that both note-taking alone and combined with the LLM had significant positive effects on retention and comprehension compared to the LLM alone. Yet, most students preferred using the LLM over note-taking, and perceived it as more helpful. Qualitative results revealed that many students valued LLMs for making complex material more accessible and reducing cognitive load, while they appreciated note-taking for promoting deeper engagement and aiding memory. Additionally, we identified ""archetypes"" of prompting behaviour, offering insights into the different ways students interacted with the LLM. Overall, our findings suggest that, while note-taking promotes cognitive engagement and long-term comprehension and retention, LLMs may facilitate initial understanding and student interest. The study reveals the continued importance of traditional learning approaches, the benefits of combining AI use with traditional learning over using AI alone, and the AI skills that students need to maximise those benefits.","Effects of LLM Use and NoteTaking on Reading Comprehension and Memory: A Randomised Experiment in Secondary Schools [SEP] The rapid uptake of Generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), by students raises urgent questions about their effects on learning.

Exploring the Impact of Generative AI ChatGPT on Critical Thinking in Higher Education: Passive AI?Directed Use or Human–AI Supported Collaboration?,"Generative AI is weaving into the fabric of many human aspects through its transformative power to mimic human-generated content. It is not a mere technology; it functions as a generative virtual assistant, raising concerns about its impact on cognition and critical thinking. This mixed-methods study investigates how GenAI ChatGPT affects critical thinking across cognitive presence (CP) phases. Forty students from a four-year university in the southwestern United States completed a survey; six provided their ChatGPT scripts, and two engaged in semi-structured interviews. Students’ self-reported survey responses suggested that GenAI ChatGPT improved triggering events (M = 3.60), exploration (M = 3.70), and integration (M = 3.60); however, responses remained neutral during the resolution stage. Two modes of interaction were revealed in the analysis of students’ ChatGPT scripts: passive, AI-directed use and collaborative, AI-supported interaction. A resolution gap was identified; nonetheless, the interview results revealed that when GenAI ChatGPT was utilized with guidance, all four stages of cognitive presence were completed, leading to enhanced critical thinking and a reconceptualization of ChatGPT as a more knowledgeable other. This research suggests that the effective use of GenAI in education depends on the quality of human–AI interaction. Future directions must orient toward an integration of GenAI in education that positions human and machine intelligence not as a substitution but as co-participation, opening new epistemic horizons while reconfiguring assessment practices to ensure that human oversight, critical inquiry, and reflective thinking remain at the center of learning.","Exploring the Impact of Generative AI ChatGPT on Critical Thinking in Higher Education: Passive AI?Directed Use or Human–AI Supported Collaboration?

Quantitative research was conducted, obtaining data from 385 visually impaired university students through a structured survey design. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) was implemented to test the study hypotheses. The findings revealed that trust in LLMs can significantly predict LLM usage, which in turn can improve QoL. While LLM usage failed to directly support the academic success of disabled students, but its impact was mediated through QoL, suggesting that enhancements in well-being can contribute to higher academic success. The results highlighted the importance of promoting trust in AI applications, along with developing an accessible, inclusive, and student-centred digital environment. The study offers practical contributions for educators and policymakers, shedding light on the importance of LLM applications for both the QoL and academic success of visually impaired university students.","Measuring the Impact of Large Language Models on Academic Success and Quality of Life Among Students with Visual Disability: An Assistive Technology Perspective [SEP] In the rapid digital era, artificial intelligence (AI) tools have progressively arisen to shape the education environment. In this context, large language models (LLMs) (i.e., ChatGPT vs. 4.0 and Gemini vs. 2.5) have emerged as powerful applications for academic inclusion. This paper investigated how using and trusting LLMs can impact the academic success and quality of life (QoL) of visually impaired university students. Quantitative research was conducted, obtaining data from 385 visually impaired university students through a structured survey design. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) was implemented to test the study hypotheses.
