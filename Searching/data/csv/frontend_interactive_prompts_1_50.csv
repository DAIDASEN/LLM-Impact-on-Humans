1,Feed,Masonry feed with infinite scroll,Hard,masonry;infinite-scroll;IntersectionObserver;skeleton;responsive;virtualization,"Build a Xiaohongshu/Pinterest-style masonry feed page.

Tech stack: React 18 + TypeScript. Styling: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components. No backend—use an in-memory mock API module (Promise-based, with randomized latency and occasional failures). Requirements apply to all tasks unless explicitly overridden: responsive layout, loading/empty/error states, keyboard accessibility, and sensible ARIA semantics.

Functional requirements:
- Render a 2-column masonry grid on >=768px and 1-column on smaller screens. Items have variable heights.
- Implement infinite scrolling using IntersectionObserver (not scroll listeners). When the sentinel is visible, fetch the next page.
- Deduplicate items across pages by id. Preserve scroll position on window resize.
- Lazy-load images with a low-quality placeholder and swap to full resolution on load.
- Show skeleton cards while fetching, and show a “Retry” inline card if a page request fails.

Data/model:
- Each item: id, coverImageUrl, title, authorName, likeCount, savedCount, tags[], createdAt.
- Mock API: GET /feed?page=1..N&tag=optional.

Accessibility & UX:
- Ensure focus never gets trapped during loading. Provide a “Skip to content” link.
- Cards are keyboard-focusable; Enter opens a detail drawer (can be stubbed) with title + stats.

Acceptance criteria:
- Infinite scroll works reliably and does not trigger duplicate fetches.
- Masonry layout visually fills vertical gaps (native CSS masonry if available; otherwise implement a reasonable fallback).
- All three states (loading/empty/error) are demonstrably reachable via mock settings."
2,Feed,Card actions with optimistic like/save,Medium,optimistic-ui;undo;toast;state-management,"Implement interactive feed cards with Like and Save actions.

Tech stack: React 18 + TypeScript. Styling: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components. No backend—use an in-memory mock API module (Promise-based, with randomized latency and occasional failures). Requirements apply to all tasks unless explicitly overridden: responsive layout, loading/empty/error states, keyboard accessibility, and sensible ARIA semantics.

Functional requirements:
- Each card has Like and Save toggle buttons and displays counts.
- Use optimistic updates: toggle immediately, then reconcile with mock API response.
- If the request fails, revert state and show a toast with an “Undo” action and error message.
- Provide subtle micro-interactions (button pressed state, count transitions) without heavy animation.

Data/model:
- Mock API: POST /items/:id/like, POST /items/:id/save returning updated counts.
- Maintain per-item pending state so rapid toggles do not corrupt counts (queue or latest-wins strategy).

Accessibility & UX:
- Buttons must be reachable by keyboard and announce toggled state (aria-pressed).
- Toast region must be screen-reader friendly (aria-live polite).

Acceptance criteria:
- Rapidly toggling Like/Save does not create negative counts or inconsistent UI.
- Undo restores the previous state deterministically."
3,Feed,Scrollable tag filter bar,Medium,tabs;filtering;horizontal-scroll;sticky-header,"Build a sticky, horizontally scrollable tag filter bar for the feed.

- Selecting a segment or tag refetches the feed (reset to page 1) and visually indicates the active filter.
- Persist the user’s last selection in localStorage and restore on reload.

Accessibility & UX:
- Segmented control follows ARIA tab/tabpanel or radiogroup conventions.
- Tag chips are keyboard navigable (Left/Right arrow optional).

Acceptance criteria:
- Filter changes reset pagination and clear previous results without flicker.
- Sticky header does not overlap content when using “Skip to content”."

- Carousel supports: previous/next buttons, swipe/drag (mouse), keyboard Left/Right, and dot indicators.
- Double-clicking the main image triggers Like (optimistic) and shows a lightweight heart animation overlay.
- Like count and Save count in the feed card must stay in sync with the detail view.

Data/model:

- Mock API for like/save as in Task 2.

Accessibility:
- Modal traps focus and is dismissible via Esc; returns focus to the originating card on close.
